This utility allows you to generate all the possible anagrams of
a phrase given a particular word list and the following restrictions:

1. case is normalized to lowercase

2. all non-word characters are stripped away

3. all word lists returned are sorted

4. two arrangements of the same words are considered the same anagram -- only the anagram produced by the canonical sort order is returned
