This utility allows you to generate all the possible anagrams of
a phrase given a particular word list and the following restrictions:

1. case is normalized to lowercase

2. all non-word characters are stripped away

3. two arrangements of the same words are considered the same anagram

The longer the phrase you seek to extract anagrams from, the more memory you will need.
You can save memory by not requiring that only unique or sorted anagrams be returned, as this
requires that anagrams be passed through a sorted set first. If you sort, all the anagrams are returned
at the end. If you only require uniqueness, they will be streamed out as they are discovered.
